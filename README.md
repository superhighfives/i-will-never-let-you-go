> ðŸš¨ **Note:** It's been a long time since this project was built, and the underlying technologies have changed. A lot. With the goal of keeping the spirit of this project alive, I've created a modern version, mostly by patching and noodling my way through already minified code. As a result, [I Will Never Let You Go](https://iwillneverletyougo.wearebrightly.com/) works on modern devices, like mobile, but this repo is no longer reflective of the underlying code. [You can find the original repo here](https://github.com/superhighfives/iwnlyg-archive).
