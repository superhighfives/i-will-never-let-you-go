# I Will Never Let You Go

> ðŸš¨ **Note:** It's been a long time since this project was built, and the underlying technologies have changed. A lot. With the goal of keeping the spirit of this project alive, I've created a modern version, mostly by patching and noodling my way through already minified code. As a result, [I Will Never Let You Go](https://iwillneverletyougo.wearebrightly.com/) works on modern devices, like mobile, but this repo only hosts that Frankenstein's monster and not the underlying code.
